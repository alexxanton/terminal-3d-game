# Terminal 3D Game

A "3D" terminal-based game written in Java. Navigate through a 3D grid rendered in the terminal using ASCII characters.

## Features

- "3D" rendering using ASCII characters.
- Player movement (left, right, forward, backward).
- Jumping (a bit clunky, but it's the best I could get for a terminal game made with Java and JLine).
- Dynamic screen updates.
- Sound effects.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or later.
- **ALSA and PulseAudio**: May be required for sound playback on Linux.
